ACSS Parity Plan — Overview

Goal
- Achieve feature parity (or better) with Automatic.css utilities while delivering a React/Node-first experience (Provider, WS Studio, Tailwind plugin, CLI).

How this plan is organized
- Phase documents detail actionable tasks and acceptance criteria:
  - PHASE-P1-FOUNDATION.md — utility coverage baseline
  - PHASE-P2-RECIPES-COMPONENTS.md — recipes, forms, layout patterns
  - PHASE-P3-PLATFORMS-TOOLS.md — CLI polish, platform integration, workflow
  - PHASE-P4-DOCS-STUDIO-QA.md — docs parity, studio features, testing

Tracking
- Use CHECKLIST.md for a single-page status view. ROADMAP.md captures high-level milestones.
